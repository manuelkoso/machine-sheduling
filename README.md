# Mathematical optimisation - Project 

This repository contains the implementation of the two methods that use integer linear programming (MILP and MILP+) described in the following article: [Exact algorithms for a parallel machine scheduling problem with workforce and contiguity constraints](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2023.106484).

## Folder structure

- `src`: code source folder
- `data`: instances [shared](https://github.com/regor-unimore/Parallel-Machine-Scheduling-with-Contiguity) by the authors 
- `output`: results obtained by the two models with different instances
- `log`: here is saved the log file
